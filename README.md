## Flask_Manhole_Detection

This project focuses on detecting manholes in images and classifying them as either open or closed. It utilizes computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to perform the detection and classification tasks.

## Introduction

Manhole covers are crucial elements of urban infrastructure, and their status (open or closed) can impact safety and road maintenance efforts. This project aims to automate the process of detecting manholes in images and determining whether they are open or closed. By leveraging computer vision techniques, such as object detection and classification, the system provides a valuable tool for urban planners, municipal authorities, and infrastructure maintenance teams.

## Features

- Detection of manholes in images.
- Classification of manholes as open or closed.
- Real-time processing and analysis of images.
- User-friendly interface for uploading images and viewing results.
